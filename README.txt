# SMARTSORT-AN-ENHANCED-DEEP-LEARNING-MODEL-FOR-ACCURATE-RECYCLABLE-WASTE-CLASSFICATION
Waste classification plays a crucial role in waste management by
categorizing materials based on their type to ensure proper disposal and recycling
.This project proposes the use of deep learning techniques, specifically the
VGG16 architecture, to automate the classification of waste materials into
categories such as paper, plastic, glass, metal, and organic. By leveraging
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based on the VGG16 model, the system
is designed to efficiently classify waste images, which are pre-processed and
augmented to improve accuracy. Additionally, the project incorporates the YOLO
model for real-time object detection to enhance the system's functionality. The
proposed smart waste classification system aims to address the growing need for
precise and automated waste sorting. The VGG16 architecture, renowned for its
deep layers and capability to learn complex features from images, forms the core
of this system. By processing large datasets of waste images, the system
significantly reduces human intervention and enhances classification accuracy,
which is vital for effective recycling and waste reduction. The integration of
YOLO for real- time detection further strengthens the systemâ€™s ability to classify
waste materials swiftly and accurately
